abstract = {A series of recent measurements of the outflow of ionization from the ionosphere have further heightened our awareness of the strength of the ionospheric source of magnetospheric plasmas. In this paper the ionospheric contribution of the polar wind and cleft ion fountain at energies less than 10 eV has been added to the previously measured sources; this total ion outflow has then been used to calculate the resulting ion density in the different internal regions of the earth's magnetosphere: plasmasphere, plasma trough, plasma sheet, and magnetotail lobes. Using estimated volumes for these regions and an ion residence time characteristic of each region, we have found that the observed magnetospheric densities can be attained in all cases with no contribution from the solar wind plasma. In the case of the plasma sheet the ionospherically supplied density is more than enough to match the observations and even suggests an invisible component of low-energy plasma (< 10 eV) which has never been observed. A detailed comparison between the calculated ionospheric source effects in the plasma sheet and those recently measured by ISEE shows excellent agreement and suggests a direct polar low-energy ion source for the plasma sheet which has remained unmeasured because of spacecraft potential effects. Although the solar wind is clearly the earth's magnetospheric energy source and energetic solar wind ions are observed in the magnetosphere, these calculations suggest the possibility that the ionospheric source alone is sufficient to supply the entire magnetospheric plasma content under all geomagnetic conditions.},

abstract = {The proton aurora imager SI-12 on the IMAGE spacecraft occasionally observes subauroral morning proton spots (SAMPS) that rotate with 70–95\% of the Earth's corotation speed. Coincident particle measurements by DMSP confirm the source to be pure precipitating protons with mean energies likely above the detector limit of 30 keV. The spots appear in the recovery phase after magnetic storms and last for 1–4 hours in the magnetic local time region of 0300–1200 hours. The latitude location is strongly related to the minimum Dst of the previous geomagnetic storm with the lowest latitude observations after the strongest storms. The rotation speed is related to the latitude (L shell) of the spots with the largest corotation lags for spots that map to the largest L shells. IMAGE-EUV observations of the plasmasphere indicate a relationship with density gradients in the expanding plasmasphere after magnetic storms. We interpret these spots as the result of wave-particle interaction. As one likely process, we suggest the interaction of ring current protons with electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) waves as a result of the expansion and subrotation of the dense, cold plasmasphere ions. The appearance of subauroral proton spots is therefore a consequence of the plasmasphere refilling after geomagnetic storms.},

abstract = {Auroral arcs frequently exhibit bands of enhanced intensity along the bottom edge. These bands have sharp upper borders and are referred to as enhanced lower borders or auroral hems. They are thought to be related to thin layers of enhanced luminosity observed both in auroral arcs and in pulsating auroras. These anomalous distributions of intensity as a function of altitude are referred to collectively as enhanced aurora (EA) and are of interest because they suggest a more complex process for producing auroral ionization and luminosity than the collisional degradation of precipitating electrons. Spectra of eight auroral hems were obtained with an imaging spectrograph and showed consistently that within the hem, there is an enhanced ratio of N2 1st positive emissions (red) to N2+ 1st negative emissions (blue). The enhancement in the red/blue ratio ranged from 10\% to 100\%. There was a generally smaller and less consistent enhancement in the ratio of the O2+ 1st negative band at 5275 Å to the N2+ 1st negative. Observations of the far red spectra of several hems showed no enhancement in the ratio of N2 1st positive to N2+ Meinel emissions. There were no simultaneous measurements of the Meinel and the N2+ 1st negatives. It is argued that the enhanced spectral ratios are indicative of a population of suprathermal electrons with a sharp energy cutoff near the ionization potential of N2 and that the electrons are energized in situ through wave-particle interactions or possibly by dc electric fields. It is also noted that some but not all of the hems are type b red lower borders.},

abstract = {Stable auroral red (SAR) arcs are diffuse, persistent, practically monochromatic (λλ 6300–6364 Å) auroral forms peculiar to mid-latitude regions of earth. Measurements of such parameters as spectral composition, geomagnetic location, range of intensity, and frequency of occurrence lead to the conclusion that the phenomenon is due to the excitation of atomic oxygen by hot electrons in the plasmapause region. However, on the basis of the data available, it is not clear whether fresh electrons are precipitating into the region of the arc or whether ambient electrons are being heated in place. There is strong evidence that the source of energy in either case is the ring current. Suggested mechanisms by which energy is transferred from the ring current to the electrons in the SAR arc region are (1) heat flow, that is, transfer of kinetic energy to the SAR arc region by Coulomb collisions, (2) transfer of ring current proton kinetic energy to hydromagnetic waves, which are in turn damped by the electrons in the SAR arc region, and (3) direct influx of energetic electrons into the SAR arc region. Which of these mechanisms predominates is still not resolved at this time. There are other open questions as well, including questions dealing with the motion of the arcs and the spectral composition.},

IGY rocket II6.26F was fired into a quiescent auroral glow of about intensity I. The integral number energy spectrum of protons incident upon the atmosphere during this flight was measured to be approximately 2.5×106 exp (-E/30) protons/sec cm2 ster over the range 80 to 250 kev, where E is the proton energy in kev. The observed altitude dependence of the electron energy flux could have been produced by an integral number energy spectrum equal to 2.5×109 exp (-E/5) electrons/sec cm2 ster over the range 3 to 30 kev. IGY rocket II6.27F was fired into a bright active auroral arc. At least 75 per cent of the light in this aurora was produced by nearly monoenergetic electrons with about 6-kev energy. The electron flux varied rapidly with time; peak values were about 5×1010 electrons/sec cm2 ster. The presence of monoenergetic electrons strongly suggests an electrostatic acceleration mechanism.},

abstract = {Auroral beads, i.e., azimuthally arrayed bright spots resembling a pearl necklace, have recently drawn attention as a possible precursor of auroral substorms. We used simultaneous, ground-based, all-sky camera observations from a geomagnetically conjugate Iceland-Syowa Station pair to demonstrate that the auroral beads, whose wavelength is ∼30–50 km, evolve synchronously in the northern and southern hemispheres and have remarkable interhemispheric similarities. In both hemispheres: 1) they appeared almost at the same time; 2) their longitudinal wave number was similar ∼300–400, corresponding bead separation being ∼1° in longitude; 3) they started developing into a larger scale spiral form at the same time; 4) their propagation speeds and their temporal evolution were almost identical. These interhemispheric similarities provide strong evidence that there is a common driver in the magnetotail equatorial region that controls the major temporal evolution of the auroral beads; thus, the magnetosphere plays a primary role in structuring the initial brightening arc in this scale size.},

abstract = {Strong thermal emission velocity enhancement (STEVE) is an optical phenomenon of the subauroral ionosphere arising from extreme ion drift speeds. STEVE consists of two distinct components in true-color imagery: a mauve or whitish arc extended in the magnetic east–west direction and a region of green emission adjacent to the arc, often structured into quasiperiodic columns aligned with the geomagnetic field (the “picket fence”). This work employs high-resolution imagery by citizen scientists in a critical examination of fine-scale features within the green emission region. Of particular interest are narrow “streaks” of emission forming underneath field-aligned picket fence elements in the 100- to 110-km altitude range. The streaks propagate in curved trajectories with dominant direction toward STEVE from the poleward side. The elongation is along the direction of motion, suggesting a drifting point-like excitation source, with the apparent elongation due to a combination of motion blur and radiative lifetime effects. The cross-sectional dimension is <1 km, and the cases observed have a duration of ∼20–30 s. The uniform coloration of all STEVE green features in these events suggests a common optical spectrum dominated by the oxygen 557.7-nm emission line. The source is most likely direct excitation of ambient oxygen by superthermal electrons generated by ionospheric turbulence induced by the extreme electric fields driving STEVE. Some conjectures about causal connections with overlying field-aligned structures are presented, based on coupling of thermal and gradient-drift instabilities, with analogues to similar dynamics observed from chemical release and ionospheric heating experiments.},

abstract = {Abstract Auroral emission at 427.8-nm from N2+ ions is caused by precipitation of energetic electrons, or by resonant scattering of sunlight by auroral N2+ ions. The latter often causes impressive purple aurora at high altitudes. However, statistical characteristics of auroral 427.8-nm emission have not been well studied. In this paper we report occurrence characteristics of high 427.8-nm emission intensities (more than 100 R) at subauroral latitudes, based on measurements by a filter-tilting photometer over 14 years (2005–2018) at Athabasca, Canada (magnetic latitude: ~62°). We divided the data set into solar elevation angles (θs) more than and less than −24° (shadow height of sunlight: 600 km) to separate the 427.8-nm emissions caused by resonant scattering of sunlight and those excited by auroral electrons, respectively. The occurrence rate of 427.8-nm emissions of more than 100 R is 10.6\% and 7.65\% for θs more than and less than −24°, respectively, confirming that resonant scattering of sunlight by N2+ ions is a cause of the strong 427.8-nm emissions of more than 100 R in the sunlit ionosphere. The occurrence rate is high in the postmidnight sector and increases with increasing geomagnetic activity, solar wind speed, and density. The occurrence rate is lowest in winter. A high occurrence rate was observed in 2015–2018, during the declining phase of the 11-year solar activity. Superposed epoch analysis indicates that the 427.8-nm emission exceeds 100 R when solar wind speed increases and solar wind density concurrently decreases, though the standard deviation of the data is rather large.},

The formation and evolution of WTS are the key to understanding the dynamics of substorm. However, the generation mechanism of WTS remains unclear. This study investigates the magnetospheric driver of WTS using numerical simulations of the Inertialized Rice Convection Model. We model a typical WTS event by specifying a low-entropy bubble injection from the magnetotail. The simulated characteristics of the WTS are consistent with typical observed features. Simulation confirms that the bubble injection creates an intense upward Region-1 field-aligned current to flow into the ionosphere, which is responsible for the prominent auroral structure. Moreover, the calculated speed of westward expansion of the bubble in the magnetosphere agrees very well with the speed of the westward surge in the ionosphere. Therefore, the plasma-sheet bubble is believed to be a possible magnetospheric source of the WTS.},

abstract = {Abstract Auroral streamers have been found to be a particularly important cause of magnetic perturbations within the auroral oval during substorms. We present a detailed investigation on the association of equatorward extending auroral streamers with ground magnetic perturbations at locations initially equatorward of the auroral oval using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions imagers and ground magnetometers. Based on the analysis of four events, we show that negative perturbations in the horizontal (H) component at initially subauroral latitudes were not seen prior to streamer onset, and the peak negative H-bay at subauroral latitudes coincided with the equatorward extending auroral streamers. Although stations close to the poleward boundary of auroral oval showed modest H-component perturbations in response to the substorm onset and poleward auroral intensifications, the abrupt and large responses within the oval were associated with the onset of streamers. Results confirm that ground magnetic perturbations that are traditionally perceived as signatures of magnetic substorm onset are not always an auroral substorm onset but can also be related to auroral streamers. These results are supported by the remarkable correlation of positive bay onset and sudden Pi2 enhancement with the onset of auroral streamers, irrespective of the classical substorm onset. In addition, the magnitude of positive bay and amplitude of Pi2 pulsations, particularly at subauroral latitudes, are enhanced during the events of equatorward extending streamers. In general, all streamer events were accompanied by dipolarization and electron flux enhancement at geosynchronous orbit that continue to strengthen during the emergence of bright streamers.},

The GUs mainly occur within ∼4 h following the beginning of the storm main phase and finish in ±4 h around the storm peak. The most interesting feature is that the anti-sunward edge of GUs is quasi-stable (18–19 h MLT) during their lifetime. The latitudinal amplitudes of GUs (AGU) peak at 200–300 km while the azimuthal wavelengths (WGU) occupy several discrete values between 100 and 900 km. Both AGU and WGU are quasi-proportional to the strength of the storms, and AGU is also proportional to WGU. There are some differences in the characteristics of AGU and WGU between pre- and post dusk sectors. These results would provide both statistical insight for mechanisms of dynamic auroral structures and data sources for validating magnetosphere-plasmasphere-ionosphere coupling models.},
