# Aurora Field Guide And Handbook

**Welcome!**

We are a team of scientists and citizen scientists, all united by a shared passion for the aurora! Together, in the [Auroral Research Coordination: Towards Internationalised Citizen Science (ARCTICS)](https://collab.issibern.ch/arctics/) group, weâ€™ve combined our expertise to create two valuable resources for the aurora community.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find two key resources designed to support citizen scientist involvement in aurora research:

- **Aurora Field Guide**: A visual guide to different auroral forms, helping you identify various types of aurora in your own photographs.
- **Aurora Handbook**: A detailed guide explaining how to capture aurora images for scientific research, submit your photos, and understand how collaborations with scientists can contribute to new discoveries.

## Access to the Resources

These guides are available to you free of charge, and we hope that you enjoy them! Happy aurora hunting from the ARCTICS team!
